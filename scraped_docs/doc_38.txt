Delete your account
You can
delete your account
when you no longer need to use Atlassian account services. When you do, you’ll immediately lose access to Confluence and all other Atlassian account services, and we’ll stop billing your organization for your account. We’ll also delete your personal data from Atlassian account services.
Once your account has been deleted, you won’t be able to reactivate it or restore your personal data.
What’s deleted
When you delete your account, we’ll permanently delete your
personal data
from all Atlassian account services. Your name will be replaced by
Former user
throughout Confluence, and your Confluence personal space will be archived.
We won’t delete:
Content, comments, or files.
To manually delete the content you’ve created, follow the instructions in
Delete, restore, or purge content
.
Personal data in user-generated content.
If your personal data, such as your name, email address, or phone number, appears in the text of a Confluence Cloud page or live doc, it will remain on Confluence Cloud until the content or the site is deleted. To delete personal data from a page, live doc, blog post, or comment, you'll need to find the content using global search, then edit it to manually remove your data.
Once an account has been deleted, both the account and the personal data in it are gone forever.
How you'll appear
This is what you’ll look like to other Confluence users once you delete your account:
