Edit a global page or doc template
Confluence administrators can edit the templates and blueprints that are available in the template gallery. For information on how to edit a template that is available only in a specific space, see
Edit a template
.
Only Confluence administrators can create or edit global page or doc templates.
To edit a global page or doc template:
If you aren’t already there, go to your
Confluence Cloud
instance.
Select the wheel icon (
) in the top-right corner to open Confluence administration.
Find
Settings
in the left-hand navigation.
Select
Configuration
>
Global templates and blueprints
.
Find the template in the
Global page or doc templates
table and select the edit icon (
).
Editing a
template
is a lot like editing a page or live doc– there are only a few small differences. Currently, there’s no way to add images or attachments in templates. However, you can include variables, placeholder text, and
labels
. These features help people using these templates create rich and dynamic pages quickly.
Variables
When someone creates pages or live docs from a template with variables, they’ll fill out a form with text fields or lists for each variable in the template. The information they provide will be added to pages and live docs automatically.
Add a variable to a template
You can only add variables to templates created with the new editor.
To add a variable:
Type
/variable
, then hit
Enter
.
Select the variable token, then select
to edit it.
Enter a name for the variable, then select
Text
,
Multi-line Text
, or
List
.
A
Text
variable offers a single line of input text, a
Multi-line
variable is configurable for multiple rows and columns of input, and a
List
produces drop-down lists with definable options.
Select
Save
.
Variables with the same name must have the same parameters, as Confluence treats these as copies of the same variable. When someone creates pages or live docs from a template with two or more copies of the same variable, the text they enter for one variable will appear everywhere that a copy of that variable appears.
Example
The example below shows a custom template with five text variables — one for “New Hire,” one for “Company,” one for “Job Title,” one for “Team,” and one for “Manager”:
When someone creates pages or live docs from this template, they will be prompted to enter text into the fields where the variables appear:
When they’re finished, the text they entered will appear on the page or live docs in edit mode.
Placeholder text
Use placeholder text to add instructions or sample text to pages or live docs created from a template. Placeholder text will only appear when pages or live docs are being edited – it’s invisible to anyone who’s viewing the published version.
Add placeholder text to a template
To add placeholder text to a template in the legacy editor:
Select
+
, then select
Placeholder text
.
Type in your placeholder text, then hit
Enter
.
To add placeholder text to a template in the new editor:
Type
/placeholder
where you want the text to appear, then hit
Enter
.
Type in your placeholder text, then hit
Enter
again.
Example
The example below shows a section of the Design Systems Template that comes with
Confluence Cloud
. The grey text is placeholder text:
When someone creates pages or live docs from this template, they will see grey placeholder text while they are editing the template. However, the text will not appear in view mode. This way, it is possible to provide instructions to the person creating pages or live docs from the template without any viewers of the page seeing them.
Labels
Add a
label
to a template to apply it to pages or live docs created from that template. This is helpful if you want to create a page
properties report
to keep track of similar pages or live docs.
Add labels to a template
To add labels to a template in the legacy editor:
Select
.
Enter labels into the box, separated by the
Space
key.
Select
Add
.
Select
Close
.
To add labels to a template in the new editor:
Select
>
Add labels
.
Enter labels into the box, separated by the
Space
key.
Select
Add
.
Select
Close
.
Example
See
Create a custom report
for several examples of templates with labels.
