Manage uploaded files
Files you
upload
can be attached to pages and live docs in Confluence. Once a file is attached, you can download, delete, or edit it by uploading a new version.
Downloading attached files
Any user with permission to view content can download files that are attached to it.
To download a file attached to content:
Open the content in Confluence Cloud.
Select
to open the more options menu, then select
Attachments
.
Right click on the name of the file you’d like to download to save it to your computer, or select
Download All
(at the bottom of the table) to download all files attached to the page as a single zip file.
There's no option to download all attachments in a space at once.
Delete an attached file
Anyone with the
Delete Attachment
space permission can delete a file that is attached to a page. However, you must also have the
Space Administrator
permission to delete a specific version of a file.
To delete a file that is attached to content:
Open the content in Confluence Cloud.
Select  to open the more options menu, then select
Attachments
.
Select
Delete
next to the attachment you want to delete.
Select
OK
to confirm.
There is no option to delete all files on a given piece of content at once.
If you don’t see the
Delete
button in Step 3, you probably don’t have the permissions needed to delete attachments from a page. Contact a space administrator to request this permission (you can find a list of space administrators at the bottom of the page in
Space settings
>
Manage space
>
Space details
).
To delete a specific version of a file:
Open the page, whiteboard, or blog post in
Confluence Cloud
.
Select
to open the more options menu, then select
Attachments
.
Select the expand arrow (
) to the left of the attachment’s name to see a list of all available versions of the attachment.
Select
Delete
next to the version you want to delete.
Select
OK
to confirm.
Space administrators can restore files from the trash, but when a specific version is deleted, it cannot be restored.
Upload a new version of an attached file
To upload a new version of an attached file:
Open the page, whiteboard, or blog post in
Confluence Cloud
.
Do either of the following:
Upload a file with the same name as the current version to the page,
OR
Select the file to preview it, then select the up arrow icon. This allows you to upload a new version of an image or PDF that has a different name than the original.
To view versions of your attachments:
Open the page, whiteboard, or blog post in
Confluence Cloud
.
Select
to open the more options menu, then select
Attachments
..
Select the expand arrow (
) to the left of the attachment’s name.
All available versions of the attachment will appear below it in the table.
You can download or share previous versions of an attachment, but it is not possible to revert to a previous version.
Move a file to another item
You'll need the
Add Content
,
Add Attachment
, and
Remove Attachment
space permissions to move an attached file to another item.
To change the page that a file is attached to:
Open the page, whiteboard, or blog post in
Confluence Cloud
.
Select
to open the more options menu, then select
Attachments
.
Select
Properties
next to the attachment you want to move.
In the
Page
field, enter the name of the destination item for the attachment (for example,
My Destination Page
). If the destination item is in another space, include the space key at the beginning of the item name (for example,
DOC:My Destination Page
).
Select
Save
.
Note that the image will not appear on the content itself, but only as one of the content attachments visible in the attachments view ( >
Attachments
) and the
Attachments macro
.
Edit properties of an attached file
You'll need the
Add Attachment
permission in the space to edit the file properties.
To edit the properties of an attached file:
Select
to open the more options menu, then select
Attachments
..
Click
Properties
next to the attachment you want to edit.
This allows you to:
Change the file name
Add a comment (used in the version list and also by the Snapshot image effect)
Change the MIME type
Move the attachment to another item
Add a label to the file
Changing the MIME type may cause your file to display incorrectly.
View all attached files in a space
To view all the files in a space:
Go to the space in
Confluence Cloud
.
Next to your space's name in the sidebar, select
More actions
(•••), then
Space settings
.
Select
Attachments
from the
Content
card.
Alternately, you can
insert the space attachments macro
on a page or live doc to display a list of all the attachments in a space. If you use this method, you can use the filters to display only files with a particular label or file extension.
