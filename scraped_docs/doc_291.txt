Use Atlassian Intelligence with Confluence automation
Atlassian Intelligence for Confluence is a new virtual teammate to help you and your team to work more effectively. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, Atlassian Intelligence is a tool that is integrated into our cloud-based apps. In Confluence automation, you can use Atlassian Intelligence to quickly and easily create automated rules.
The quality, accuracy, and reliability of rules created with Atlassian Intelligence may vary.
Learn why
Atlassian Intelligence isn’t available for
Atlassian Government apps
.
How do I use Atlassian Intelligence to create a rule?
Rules are automated workflows constructed in an “if this happens, then that happens” format. Site admins can create and enable rules that function across Confluence at the site level. Space admins can create and enable rules for individual spaces. If you have a
personal space
, you’re considered an admin of this space.
You can use Atlassian Intelligence to generate rules by simply describing the rule you want to create. To get started:
Go to your space.
Next to your space's name in the sidebar, select
More actions
(•••), then
Space settings
.
Select
Automation
from the
sidebar
.
Select
Create with AI
.
Select the input box beneath
Create rules quickly with the power of AI
to begin typing.
Describe the rule you’d like to create, including a trigger and action. You can use one of the examples provided or write your own rule.
Select
Preview rule
to see a preview of the rule that was generated.
Check the summary of the rule generated by Atlassian Intelligence, and add any missing components or details.
Once you’re happy with your rule’s configuration, select
Enable rule
.
Your rule will now be enabled and visible in the rule library.
What’s required to create a rule?
Each rule is made by combining different types of components: triggers, actions, conditions, and branches. Think of components as the building blocks of a rule. To successfully create a rule with Atlassian Intelligence, your rule must
at least
contain both a trigger and an action.
Triggers
A trigger is what causes a rule to run. Your rule must contain one trigger. Triggers can listen for events, such as a page being created in your space, or be scheduled to run on a certain time or date. In the following examples, triggers are highlighted
in bold
:
Every Monday,
find all the tasks with a due date in the next 7 days, and send the assignee a reminder email.
Every 6 months,
archive any pages that haven’t been updated in that time. After archiving, send an email to the page author letting them know.
When a page is published with Product Spec in the title,
create a Jira ticket to review the page with a link to the page.
Actions
An action is what you want your rule to do. It will execute when a rule runs successfully. Examples of actions in Confluence automation can include creating a new space, sending an email or adding a label to a page when your rule successfully runs. In the following examples, actions are highlighted
in bold
:
Every Monday,
find all the tasks with a due date in the next 7 days, and send the assignee a reminder email.
Every 6 months,
archive any pages that haven’t been updated in that time. After archiving, send an email to the page author letting them know.
When a page is published with Product Spec in the title,
create a Jira ticket to review the page with a link to the page.
Keep in mind that a trigger and an action are the minimum components required to successfully create a rule. You may still need to configure components or add more details to your rule before it can be enabled. You can also add
conditions or branches
to your rule if you’d like to make it more detailed.
What components are supported by Atlassian Intelligence?
Atlassian Intelligence doesn’t support the following components:
Incoming webhook trigger
Create variable action
Send web request action
Create lookup table action
For a rule to be successfully created, all its components must be supported by Confluence automation. This means that any triggers, actions, conditions or branches in your rule must be compatible with Confluence automation. With the exception of the components mentioned above, Atlassian Intelligence can support any of the components in the following list:

What errors can occur when using Atlassian Intelligence?
When using Atlassian Intelligence to create rules in Confluence automation, it’s possible to encounter some errors. The following table provides more information about errors that can occur:
Error Type
Additional Information on Error
The volume of requests in system is too high
Atlassian Intelligence is currently processing a high volume of rule creation requests, and can’t create your rule as a result. Wait a few minutes and then try creating your rule again.
We’re unable to connect to server
Due to a connection error, we’re currently unable to connect to the server and create your rule. Wait a few minutes and then try creating your rule again.
An unknown error occurred
We’ve encountered an error that prevented us from creating your rule, but we aren’t sure what caused it. Wait a few minutes and then try creating your rule again.
We’re unable to create your rule
We tried to create your rule, however for an unspecified reason, we couldn’t finish creating it. This may be due to your requested rule not being specific enough, or containing language our system couldn’t understand. Try creating your rule again by entering a more specific prompt.
Prompt was too long
Your prompt exceeded our word limit of 300 words, meaning we aren’t able to create a rule with it. Try creating your rule again by shortening your prompt.
We’re unable to use the prompt
Your prompt may have contained malicious or unethical content, meaning we aren’t able to create a rule with it. Try creating your rule again, making sure to remove any malicious content from your prompt.
If errors persist or you'd like additional support,
