Work with images, videos, and files
Adding media to your content enhances the visual appeal and improves how you convey information. You can use images to illustrate a point, videos to provide detailed instructions, GIFs to add some fun, or files to share important documents.
Confluence supports various media formats, including:
Images:
JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP
Videos:
MP4, MOV, AVI
Audio:
MP3, WAV
Files:
PDFs, Microsoft Office documents, text files, and more.
In this guide, you can learn how to use media elements to create dynamic content that captures your audience’s attention and communicates your message more effectively.
Add media to your content
Follow these steps to add images, videos, GIFs, and files to your content:
Using the toolbar or
/
command
Select the
Add image, video, or file
on the toolbar or type
/image
on the page and select
Image, video, or file
.
Select the media file from your computer.
Dragging and dropping files
Open the content where you want to add the media.
Drag the desired file from your computer and drop it onto the content.
The file will be uploaded and added to your content.
Following these steps, you can integrate images, videos, GIFs, and files into your Confluence content, making it more engaging and appealing.
Formatting and customizing media
Resizing and aligning images and videos
Resizing and aligning images and videos can improve your content’s' visual appeal and readability. Here's how you can manage these aspects:
Using drag handles to resize
Select the image or video you want to resize.
Drag the handles on the sides of the media to adjust its size. The media will proportionally grow or shrink based on how much you drag the mouse.
While resizing with the drag handles, guides will appear to help you align the media with other elements on the page. Use these guides to ensure your media is aligned, improving your content’s layout and visual consistency.
Resizing to specific pixel values
Select the image or video you want to resize.
In the toolbar, enter the desired width or height in pixels. Note that only one dimension (width or height) can change at a time; the other dimension will adjust proportionally.
Converting to pixel-based resizing
Pixel-based resizing sets the media dimensions in fixed pixel values, ensuring consistency across screen sizes and resolutions. Percentage-based sizing adjusts the media dimensions relative to the page or doc width, which can cause inconsistency on different devices.
Select the media item that needs conversion (it will have a yellow dot in the top-right corner).
Either drag the handle to resize the item or select the
Convert to pixels
in the toolbar to switch to pixel-based sizing.
By resizing and aligning your images and videos, you can enhance your content’s visual impact and readability, ensuring it is well-organized and appealing.
Customizing image and video settings
Customizing image and video settings can help you enhance the visual presentation and accessibility of your media. Here's how you can adjust various settings:
Adding captions
Select the image or video you want to caption.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Add caption
option.
Enter your caption text. You can’t change the text size and alignment but can apply other formatting.
Adjusting border options
Select the image or video.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Border options
.
Select your desired border color and size.
Setting image alignment
Select the image or video.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Image alignment
.
Select how you want the image or video aligned on the page or doc and how the text should flow around it.
Displaying images inline or as block elements
Inline:
Select the image you want to display within the text flow. This option allows the image to be part of the text content, making it flow naturally with the surrounding text.
Original size:
Select the image you want to display as a separate block element. This option displays the image at its original size, separate from the text flow, making it stand out.
Select the image you want to display inline or as a block element.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Inline
or
Original size
option.
Adding links to images
Select the image.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Link
option.
Add a link to content or an external URL.
Previewing images
Select the image.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Preview
option to view the full-size image while editing.
Editing alt text for accessibility
Select the image or video.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Edit alt text
option.
Supplemental text should accompany the media, providing context and meaning to all users. Alt text is especially effective in assisting people who rely on screen readers.
Managing file settings
Managing file settings lets you control how files display and interact on your content. Here’s how you can manage your file settings:
Displaying files as inline tiles or thumbnails
You can select to display files as either inline tiles or thumbnails to enhance the visual presentation and accessibility of your content.
Inline tiles:
Select the file you want to display.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Change view
option.
Select
Inline
to display the file as an inline tile.
Thumbnails:
Select the file you want to display.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Change view
option.
Select
Thumbnail
to display the file as a thumbnail.
Previewing files
Select the file you want to preview.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Preview
option.
The file will open in viewer mode, allowing you to see its contents without downloading.
Downloading files
Select the file you want to download.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Download
option.
The file will download to your computer or device.
Collaborating on media
Collaborating on media in Confluence allows teams to interact, comment, and share insights on images and videos. Here's how you can collaborate using media:
Adding and viewing comments
Adding comments to images and videos can facilitate discussions and feedback.
Adding comments:
Select the image or video you want to comment on.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Add/view comment
option.
Type your comment in the provided field and submit it.
Viewing comments:
Select the image or video with existing comments.
In the floating toolbar, select the
Add/view comment
option to see all comments associated with the media.
Embedding social videos and images
Using the Widget connector macro, you can embed live content from various social media platforms to enrich your Confluence pages.
Embedding YouTube, Vimeo, and Flickr content:
Copy the URL of the content you want to embed.
Paste the URL onto your Confluence page or live doc.
The link will automatically convert into a playable video or viewable image.
Exploring additional macros:
Browse through the
