Use macros to add navigation on Confluence pages
Cloud
Data Center
Insert the table of content zone macro
You can use the Table of Content Zone macro to mark out a section (zone) within the page or live doc from which to create a table of contents. You can style the headings as a flat list, and place the list of links at the top and bottom of the section or page or doc, to provide navigation bars similar to web navigation.
Use the Table of Content Zone macro
To add the Table of Content Zone macro:
When editing, select
from the toolbar
Find the macro by name and select it
Configure it as needed
You can also type / on the page to bring up the same list you'd see by selecting
from the toolbar. Continue typing the name of the macro to filter the list.
To edit the Table of Content Zone macro:
Select the macro placeholder.
Select the Edit
icon
to open the configuration panel.
Configure the parameters. Your changes are saved as you go.
Resume editing the page, and the panel closes.
You can also select the centered
, medium-width
, and full-width
icons to adjust the width of some macros. Select the trashcan icon
to remove the macro.
Parameters
Parameters are options that you can set to control what and how content from the macro appears on a page or live doc.
If the parameter name used in
Confluence Cloud
storage format is different than the label used when inserting macros using the browser or the slash command, it will be listed below in brackets (
example
).
Parameter
Default
Description
location
(location
)
both
Specifies where in the zone the output list is displayed:
top
,
bottom
, or
both
, which encloses the page zone content.
Output Type
(type
)
list
Specifies the layout for the table of contents:
list
– produces a vertical list, typical of a TOC.
flat
– produces a horizontal menu-type series of links, for example: [Heading 1] [Heading 2] [Heading 3].
Display Section Numbering
(outline
)
false
Select to apply outline numbering to your headings, for example: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.
List Style
(style
)
none
Specifies the style of bullet point for each list item.  You can use any valid CSS style.  For example:
none
— no list style is displayed
circle
---  the list style is a circle
disc
— the list style is a filled circle. This is the typical bullet list, and is the one we're using for this example list
square
— the list style is a square
decimal
— the list is numbered (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
lower-alpha
— the list is lower-case, alphabetized (a, b, c, d, e)
lower-roman
— the list style is lower roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi)
upper-roman
— the list style is upper roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, VI)
Heading Indent
(indent
)
Sets the indent for a
list
output type, according to CSS quantities. Entering "10px" will successively indent list heading levels by 10px. For example, h1 headings will be indented 10px and h2 headings will be indented an additional 10px.
Separator
(separator
)
brackets
Only applies to the
flat
output type
.
Specifies the display style of the links.  You can enter any of the following values:
brackets
— Each item is enclosed by square brackets: [ ].
braces
— Each item is enclosed by braces: { }.
parens
— Each item is enclosed by parentheses: ( ).
pipe
— Each item is separated by a pipe:
anything
— Each is separated by the value you enter. You can enter any text as a separator, for example
'***'
. If using a custom separator, be aware that text displays exactly as entered, with no additional white space to further separate the characters.
Minimum Heading Level
(minLevel
)
1
Select the largest heading level to start your TOC  list.  For example, 2 will list h2, h3, and h4 headings, but will not include h1 headings.
Max Heading Level
(maxLevel
)
7
Select the smallest heading level to include in the TOC.  For example, 2 will list h1 and h2, but will not include h3 and below.
Include Headings
(include
)
Filter the included headings according to specific criteria. You can use wildcard characters. See
Sun's Regex documentation
for examples of constructing regular expression strings.
Exclude Headings
(exclude
)
Exclude headings according to specific criteria. You can use wildcard characters. See
Sun's Regex documentation
for examples of constructing regular expression strings.
Printable
(printable
)
true
By default, the TOC is set to print. If you clear this parameter, the TOC will not be visible when you print the page.
CSS Class Name
(class
)
If you have a custom TOC in your CSS style sheet, you can use this parameter to output the TOC with the specified "class" attribute.
Examples

Parameter
Value
Output Type

Parameter
Value
Output Type
flat
Separator
brackets
Max Heading Level

Wiki markup example
Wiki markup is only supported in the legacy editor.
Wiki markup is useful when you need to add a macro outside the editor, for example as custom content in the sidebar, header or footer of a space.
Macro name:
toc-zone
Macro body:
Accepts rich text.
{toc-zone:printable=false|maxLevel=2|minLevel=2|location=top|type=flat|outline=true|separator=pipe}
Only headings within this block are included in the table of contents.
{toc-zone}
Notes
Due to an outstanding issue in the Table of Content Zone macro (
CONF-10619
), the Macro Browser's
Refresh
function does not render any parameter modifications. Currently, the rendering of parameter value modifications to the Table of Content Zone macro occurs only after the page is saved.
