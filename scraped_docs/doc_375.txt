Advanced PDF export customizations
This page provides information about 'advanced' PDF export customizations. These expand upon the regular customizations described in
Customize exports to PDF
.
The information below is for advanced users. Be aware that the advanced customizations described below require knowledge of certain parts of Confluence, and of CSS and HTML. Customizations are not supported by Atlassian, so our support engineers won't be able to help you with these modifications.
Header and footers
Adding headers and footers to single page exports
Single page exports don't support
adding HTML headers and footers via the PDF export page
, but you can use CSS rules in the PDF stylesheet field (found within
Space Settings
>
PDF export
in the Look and feel card) to produce headers and/or footers for a single page export.
For custom headers, define any of the following rules within your
@page
rule:
@top-left
,
@top-center,
and
@top-right
. These rules allow you to define the
content
of the left-hand side, center and right-hand side of your page's header area, respectively.
For custom footers, define
@bottom-left
,
@bottom-center
and
@bottom-right
rules within your
@page
rule.
For example, the following rules add a document title at the center of the header and a page number at the center of the footer:
CSS - PDF Stylesheet
@page
{
@top-center
{
content: "Document Title Goes Here"; /* This is the content that will appear in the header */
font-family: ConfluenceInstalledFont, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
font-size: 8pt;
}
@bottom-center
{
content: "Page " counter(page); /* This is the content that will appear in the footer */
font-family: ConfluenceInstalledFont, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
font-size: 8pt;
}
/* Any other page-specific rules */
}
Notes:
The
font-family
and
font-size
properties ensure that the header and footer text is rendered in the same default font style used for the body text, based on the default CSS rules.
It is not possible to use this method to insert images (stored as attachments within your Confluence instance) into the headers and footers of single page exports.
Adding images to headers and footers
To insert an image into the header or footer, add HTML to the Header or Footer fields of the PDF Layout.
The following example uses an HTML
img
element with
src
attribute to add an image to the left of the header. The
src
attribute refers to an image attached to a Confluence page. The image element is usually placed within a
div
element container.
HTML - PDF Layout: Header
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: right; margin-left: 0.5in; font-size: 10px; height: 20px; overflow: hidden;">
<img src="https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/12346/header-image.png" style="height: 50px;" />
</div>
In the example above, the header includes an image called 'header-image.png'. The "12346" in the
src
attribute is the ID number of the page to which the image is attached.
Follow these instructions to include an image on your page or live doc:
Attach the image to a Confluence page or live doc.
View the list of attachments on that page or doc, then right-click the image and copy its location.
Paste the link into the appropriate
src=""
attribute in your PDF Stylesheet, as shown above.
Edit the image URL so that it is relative, by removing the first part of the URL before
/download/...
.
Notes:
This example uses an inline CSS property
margin-top
in the
style
attribute to force the image away from the top of the page by 10mm. This comes in handy when your header image is large enough to touch or spill over the top of the page.
Likewise, for footers, you can use the
margin-bottom:XXmm
property to force an image away from the bottom of the page by 'XX' mm.
Very large images can spill over into the body of a page or alter the position of text or other elements used within a header or footer. In such situations, it is recommended that you reduce the size of the image and then attach it to your Confluence page again. If you prefer to keep the image size and want to move the content lower instead, you can do so by configuring the
margin-top
properties in the
@page
CSS rule.
By default, a header or footer image is aligned to the left-hand side of the page. However, you can align this image to the center or right-hand side of a page by adding either the
text-align:center
or
text-align:right
properties to your
style
attribute. For example, to align the header image to the right-hand side of the page, your
style
attribute would look similar to this:
style="margin-top:10mm; text-align:right"
.
Adding a dynamic title to the title page
When you export an arbitrary set of pages or docs from Confluence, you may like to have a corresponding title added to the cover (or title) page automatically. This can be done (in a somewhat irregular way) by using the top level item from the default table of contents as the title. This method relies on having the exported pages structured as sub-pages of the top-level page. In other words, the pages to be exported should consist of a page (at the top-level) and all of its child pages. The result is that the title that appears on the cover page changes depending on the top-level page that is used for the export.
The CSS below moves, and styles, the top-level TOC item for use as the title on the cover page, and turns off the leader and page number normally associated with this item in the TOC.
CSS - PDF Stylesheet
.fsTitlePage {
position: relative;
left: 0px;
}
/* Turn off the default section numbering for this TOC item */
.toclvl0:before {
content: "";
counter-reset: chapter 0; /* Ensure there's a parent element with a counter for this to work */
}
/* Hide the default page numbering for this TOC item */
.toclvl0 .tocnum {
display: none;
}
/* Move and style this TOC item */
.toclvl0 {
position: absolute;
top: 250px;
font-size: 42px;
font-weight: bold;
margin: 72px 0 4px 0;
text-align: center;
}
