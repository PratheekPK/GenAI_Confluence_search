Insert the chart macro
The Chart macro allows you to display a chart based on tabular data. When you add the macro to a page or live doc, you:
supply the data to be charted by the macro as a table in the placeholder of the macro.
edit the macro parameters in the Macro Browser to configure the format of the chart.
Use the Chart macro
To add the Chart macro:
When editing, select
from the toolbar
Find the macro by name and select it
Configure it as needed
You can also type / on the page to bring up the same list you'd see by selecting
from the toolbar. Continue typing the name of the macro to filter the list.
To enter your chart data:
Select a chart type using the
Type
parameter (see below).
Choose other parameter settings in the macro browser, as described below.
Use a zero to represent that there is no value for a data series or data type. Leaving the cell blank/null causes problems when showing the chart.
To edit the Chart macro:
Select the macro placeholder.
Select the Edit
icon
to open the configuration panel.
Configure the parameters. Your changes are saved as you go.
Resume editing the page, and the panel closes.
You can also select the centered
, medium-width
, and full-width
icons to adjust the width of some macros. Select the trashcan icon
to remove the macro.
Parameters
Parameters are options that you can set to control what and how content from the macro appears on a page or live doc.
If the parameter name used in
Confluence Cloud
storage format is different than the label used when inserting macros using the browser or the slash command, it will be listed below in brackets (
example
).
Chart Type Parameters
These parameters determine the type of chart to display and the way the chart looks.

Data Specification Parameters
The data for the chart is taken from tables found when the macro body is rendered. These options control how this data is interpreted. By default, numeric and date values are interpreted according to the Confluence global default language (locale) formats. If conversion fails, other languages defined in Confluence will be tried. Additional conversion options can be specified using the parameters below.
Parameter
Default
Description
Tables
all first level tables
Comma separated list of table ids and/or table numbers (starting at 1) contained within the body of the macro that will be used as the data for the chart. If data tables are embedded in other tables, then table selection will be required. This occurs when more complex formatting is done (for example using section and column macros).
Columns
all columns
Comma separated list of column labels and/or column titles and/or column numbers for tables used for chart data. This applies to all tables processed. Columns are enumerated starting at 1. Column label is the text for the column in the header row. Column title is the (html) title attribute for the column in the header row.
Content Orientation
horizontal
vertical
— data table columns will be interpreted as series.
horizontal
— data tables rows will be interpreted as series.
Time Series
false
true — the x values in an XY plot will be treated as time series data and so will be converted according to date formats.
Date format
Confluence language defined date formats
For time series data, the date format allows for additional customization of the conversion of data to date values. If a
Date format
is specified, it will be the first format used to interpret date values. Specify a format that matches the time series data. See
simple date format
.
Time Period
Day
The time period for time series data. Defines the granularity of how the data is interpreted. Valid values are:
Millisecond

.
Language
none
Use in combination with the
Country
parameter to form a locale. These additional number and date formats will be used for data conversion before the default languages.
Valid values are 2 character
ISO 639-1 alpha-2 codes
.
Country
none
Use in combination with the
Language
parameter to form a locale. Valid values are 2 character
ISO 3166 codes
.
Forgive
true
true — the macro tries to convert numeric and date values that do not totally match any of the default or user-specified formats.
false — enforce strict data format. Data format errors will cause the chart to not be produced.
Color Parameters

Attachment Parameters
These are advanced options that can be used for chart versioning, to enable automation and to improve performance. Use these options carefully! Normally, the chart image is regenerated each time the page pr doc is displayed. These options allow for the generated image to be saved as an attachment and have subsequent access re-use the attachment. This can be useful especially when combined with the Cache Plugin to improve performance. Depending on the options chosen, chart images can be versioned for historical purposes.
Parameter
Default
Description
Attachment
none
The name and location with which the chart image will be saved as an attachment. The user must be authorized to add attachments to the page specified.

Chart data parameters
The data for the chart is taken from tables found in the macro body. The parameters below control how this data is interpreted. By default, numeric and date values are interpreted according to the Confluence global default language (locale) formats. If conversion fails, other languages defined in Confluence will be tried. You can specify additional conversion options using the parameters below.
Parameter
Required
Default
Description
tables
No
All first level tables
You can supply a comma-separated list of table IDs and/or table numbers (starting at 1) contained within the body of the macro that will be used as the data for the chart. If data tables are embedded in other tables, then table selection will be required. This occurs when more complex formatting is done (for example using section and column macros).
columns
No
All columns
You can supply a comma-separated list of column labels and/or column titles and/or column numbers for tables used for chart data. This applies to all tables processed. Columns are enumerated starting at 1. Column label is the text for the column in the header row. Column title is the HTML title attribute for the column in the header row.
dataOrientation
No
horizontal
The content orientation. By default, the data tables will be interpreted as columns (horizontally) representing domain and x values.
Available values:
vertical
–  data table columns will be interpreted as series.
horizontal –
data tables rows will be interpreted as series.
timeSeries
No
false
If '
true
', the x values in an XY plot will be treated as time series data and so will be converted according date formats.
dateFormat
No
Confluence language defined date formats
For time series data, the date format allows for additional customization of the conversion of data to date values. If a
dateFormat
is specified, it will be the first format used to interpret date values. Specify a format that matches the time series data. See
simple date format
.
timePeriod
No
day
The time period for time series data. Defines the granularity of how the data is interpreted.
Available values:
millisecond, second, minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year
language
No
(None)
Use in combination with the
country
parameter to form a locale. These additional number and date formats will be used for data conversion before the default languages.
Available values are the two-character
ISO 639-1 alpha-2 codes
.
country
No
(None)
Use in combination with the
language
parameter to form a locale. Valid values are the two-character
ISO 3166 codes
.
forgive
No
true
Determines whether the macro will forgive (allow) some data formatting errors.
Available values:
true
— the macro tries to convert numeric and date values that do not totally match any of the default or user-specified formats.
false
— the macro enforces strict data formatting. If there are data format errors, the chart will not be produced.

Chart attachment parameters
These are advanced options that can be used for chart versioning, to enable automation and to improve performance. Use these options carefully! Normally, the chart image is regenerated each time the page or doc is displayed. These options allow for the generated image to be saved as an attachment and have subsequent access to re-use the attachment. This can be useful especially when combined with the Cache plugin to improve performance. Depending on the options chosen, chart images can be versioned for historical purposes.
