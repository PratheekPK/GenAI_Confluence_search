Display Jira work items in a list
If your Confluence instance is connected to Jira, you can search and display Jira work items in a list on Confluence pages and live docs. You can then customize the display to add, remove, and reorder fields.
Make changes to your search with keywords, filters, or
JQL (Jira Query Language)
.
If you’re an
Atlassian Marketplace
user, you may be looking for help on
using the legacy Jira work item macro
.
You can paste a link to a
single Jira work item
using
Smart Link display options
.
Insert Jira work items
Edit a Confluence page or live doc or create a new one. You have 3 options to insert Jira work items:
Option 1
Select
from the toolbar and select
Jira work items
Option 2
While editing, type
/jira
and select
Jira work items.
Option 3
You have the option to search for work items in Jira and paste the search filter URL into a Confluence page or live doc.
Search for work items
Start inserting Jira work items by using filters with basic keyword search or with JQL.
Learn how to search for Jira work items using
JQL (Jira Query Language)
.
BASIC
is selected by default. With this option, you can use filters and keywords to search for work items.
If you select
JQL
, enter your query or search keywords. For example,
project = 'Starfish'
Select
COUNT VIEW
if you want to display just the number of work items.
Select
Insert work items
.
Manage field columns
Once your Jira work items are displayed as a list, you can drag columns to move them around. Choose the columns you want to appear by selecting the column icon
.
Edit your work items
If you need to make changes to your search query, select the pencil icon
at the bottom of the list.
Resize the width of the list by selecting the expand icon
from the side.
Using the Jira legacy macro for Marketplace app users
Using the Jira macro, you can:
Display a list of work items on your page or live doc, based on a
Jira Query Language (JQL)
search, filter or URL.
Display a single work item.
Display a count of work items.
Create new work items and display the work items on your page or doc without leaving Confluence.
Use the Jira legacy macro
To add the Jira legacy macro:
When editing, select
from the toolbar
Find the macro by name and select it
Configure it as needed
You can also type / on the page to bring up the same list you'd see by selecting
from the toolbar. Continue typing the name of the macro to filter the list.
To edit the Jira legacy macro:
Select the macro placeholder.
Select the Edit
icon
to open the configuration panel.
Configure the parameters. Your changes are saved as you go.
Resume editing the page, and the panel closes.
You can also select the centered
, medium-width
, and full-width
icons to adjust the width of some macros. Select the trashcan icon
to remove the macro.
Displaying work items via a Jira Query Language (JQL) search
You can use the macro to display a list of work items on your page or doc, based on the results of a search using Jira Query Language (JQL).
JQL is a simple query language that is similar to SQL. A basic JQL query consists of a
field
, followed by an
operator
(such as = or >), followed by one or more
values
or
functions
.
Examples:
The following query will find all work items in the 'TEST' project:
project = "TEST"
The following query will find all work items in the 'documentation' component of the  'CONF' project:
project = CONF and component = documentation
For more information about JQL syntax, see
Advanced searching
in the
Jira
documentation.
To display a list of work items based on a JQL search:
Insert the Jira macro onto your Confluence page or live doc, as described above.
Choose a Jira instance next to the
Search
button.
If prompted, log in to the Jira instance.
Enter the JQL query into the
Search
box.
Select
Search
.
If you want to customize the display, select
Display options
and adjust the columns and number of work items that will appear in your list of work items.
Select
Insert
.
Displaying work items via a Jira URL
You can paste any of the following Jira application URLs into the Jira work items macro. Confluence will immediately convert the URL to a JQL search.
Any URL for a work item search or filter.
A URL for a single work item.
The URL of the XML view of a search.
Auto-convert:
You can paste URLs directly into the Confluence editor (without calling up the macro browser). Confluence will automatically convert the URL into a Jira work items macro.
Displaying a single work item, or selected work items
To display a single Jira work item
, choose one of the following methods:
Paste the URL of the work item directly onto the Confluence page or doc. (There is no need to use the macro browser.) Confluence will auto-convert the link to a Jira work items macro.
Or: Add the Jira work items macro to the page or doc as described above, and choose
Recently Viewed
to see the work items you have visited recently. Select a work item and choose
Insert
.
Or: Add the Jira work items macro to the page or doc as described above, and paste the work item URL into the search box in the macro browser.
Or: Add the Jira work items macro to the page or doc, define your search criteria in the macro browser via JQL as described above, then select the check box next to the work item in the search results, within the macro browser.
You can choose to show just the work item key, or the work item key and a summary. Select the macro placeholder and choose Show Summary or Hide Summary.
To display a subset of Jira work items from your search results:
Add the Jira work items macro to the page or live doc.
Define your search criteria in the macro browser via JQL, as described above.
Select the check boxes next to the required work items in the search results, within the macro browser.
Displaying a count of work items
You can choose to display the number of work items returned by your search, rather than a list of work items. The Jira work items macro will display a count of work items, linked to the search in your Jira application.
To display a work item count:
Add the Jira work items macro to the page or doc.
Define your search criteria in the macro browser via JQL, as described above.
Select
Display options
, then select
Total work item count
next to 'Display options' in the macro browser.
Select
Insert
.
Creating a new work item
While editing a Confluence page or live doc, you can create a work item in Jira and display it without leaving the Confluence editor.
To create a work item and add it to your page or live doc:
Add the Jira work items macro to the page or doc, as described above.
Select
Create new work item
.
Supply the information about your Jira instance, project, and work item, as prompted.
Select
Insert
.
Confluence will send a request to your Jira application, to create the work item, then display the newly created work item on your page or doc.
Limitations
The Jira legacy macro will notify you if it is unable to create a work item in the selected project. This may be because the project has a required field, field configuration or other customization that is not supported by the Jira legacy macro. In this situation you will need to create the work item directly in your Jira application.
Rendering HTML from Jira applications
Formatted fields from Jira can be displayed in Confluence if you set up a Confluence-to-Jira application link. Otherwise, such formatted fields will be escaped within the output of the Jira legacy macro. This is to prevent the possibility of malicious HTML being served by an untrusted Jira instance. The most likely field where you will notice this is in the description field.
Disabling the Jira legacy macro
Apps cannot be disabled in Atlassian Cloud applications. To stop using an app, you must either uninstall, or unsubscribe, which cancels your subscription to the app.
