Import multiple Miro boards to Confluence
Who can use this feature
Available on
all Confluence editions
Your team must have a
paid Miro license
(required for high-quality PDF exports)
You must have
export permissions
in Miro
(Miro board owners or team admins can restrict this)
Anyone who can
create a space in Confluence
can bulk import Miro boards (Confluence site admins control space creation permissions)
Moving from another tool can feel overwhelming—we’re here to make it smooth. With bulk import, you can bring multiple Miro boards into Confluence as editable Confluence whiteboards in one go.
Need to
import just one or two boards
? See
the single import guide
.
Step 1: Export boards from Miro
If you are on a Miro Enterprise Plan:
For customers on the Miro Enterprise Plan we provide an easy way to bulk export via utilizing Miro’s
Bulk export support
.
In Confluence, go to
Spaces
>
Import from other tools
.
Select
Miro
.
Select
“Bulk Export Boards”
Click “
Add API Token”
Follow the instructions that pop up
There is a limitation when using Miro’s
Bulk export support
that boards will take ~12m each to export. You can still configure and start the export/import and we will notify you via email after when it is completed.
You can also attempt using Miro’s
Bulk export support
yourself or other export options below which may be faster.
If you are on a Miro Business or Starter Plan:
If you’re not on a Miro Enterprise Plan you can manually export boards one at a time, or you can attempt using a
third-party export solution.
How to manually export boards from Miro:
To find the most relevant boards to export, sort and filter boards in your Miro dashboard by date created, viewed, or updated!
In Miro, open the board you wish to export.
Open the export menu in the top-left corner of the board, then select
Save as image
.
Select the area of the board that you’d like to export.
Select the
Vector
option.
Click the
Export
button.
Repeat this for all boards you want to import.
Compress all
PDFs
into a ZIP file (PDFs only. Folders are not supported)
For more information on exporting Miro boards,
see Miro’s support documentation
.
Step 2: Import Miro content to Confluence
Tip
: Large imports take time. We recommend keeping each ZIP under
100 boards
to speed up processing or be prepared for a longer wait!
How to import boards to Confluence:
In Confluence, go to
Spaces
>
Import from other tools
.
Select
Miro
.
Upload your prepared ZIP file or configure a bulk export.
Select an existing space or name a new space where your boards will live.
Set space permissions:
Restricted to you
– Only you can see the boards (boards will appear as created by you).
Default space permissions
– Uses your organization's default settings (if your import contains private content, we suggest using “Restricted to you” – you can update the restrictions after the import).
Concerned about plan limits or potential billing changes?
See the FAQ below.
If you are on a Free or Standard plan, imported whiteboards will be read-only by default.
This is to help you stay within your plan’s limits of 3 active whiteboards per use. If you have fewer than 3 active whiteboards, you can make a copy of an imported board later to turn it into an editable, active whiteboard.
Step 3: Transfer Miro users to Confluence
(Optional – Available with Miro Enterprise Plan)
You can optionally add Miro workspace members to Confluence during migration. Or,
skip this step
and add users later from
admin.atlassian.com
or invite users from Confluence.
We will bring in any user who does not exist in your Atlassian org and who has member access in your Miro org based on their email (guest members will not be brought over).
Prerequisites
Miro Enterprise
license
Miro
Account Admin
role
SSO enabled
in Miro

How to create Confluence accounts for Miro users:
Toggle on
Add remaining members to Confluence
.
Generate a Miro access token:
Go to Miro in your browser. (Make sure you are logged in as an
Admin
on an Enterprise account
)
Under the
Profile Icon
, select
Admin Console
.
Go to
Apps and Integrations
and select
Enterprise Integrations
.
Toggle on
SCIM provisioning
and select
Generate new token
.
When
Generate new SCIM token
dialog opens, select
Generate
.
Copy and paste the token into Confluence and
Submit
.
For more information about generating a Miro access token,
see Miro's support documentation
.

Limitations
For bulk importing, there is a 10,000 element limit and a max size  of 5 mb per board. Boards beyond that will fail at importing. (The max size is larger for
single board imports
.)
Importing comments is not supported, but you can comment on Confluence whiteboards.
Colors will be mapped to the closest Confluence whiteboards colors.
Rotated elements will import unrotated.
Shapes supported in whiteboards will import as shapes. Shapes that are not supported will import as images.
Locked elements will not remain locked when imported, but you can manually lock them in Confluence whiteboards.
Talk tracks are not supported in whiteboards.
Importing may take longer than a minute for boards with many elements, large images, or a lot of content.
If you are on a Free or Standard plan, imported whiteboards will be read-only by default. This is to help you stay within your plan’s limits of 3 active whiteboards per user.
Learn more about Confluence Whiteboard plans and features
. If you have fewer than 3 active whiteboards, you can make a copy of an imported board later to turn it into an editable, active whiteboard.
FAQs
📌 What if I have hundreds of boards and do not want to export them all on my own?
If you're on an Enterprise plan, contact your Customer Success Manager for bulk export options. In the meantime, we are working hard on ways to make bulk export easier for all customers!
📌 Can I just import a board as a static image?
Yes, but not yet via Bulk Import. If you only need a reference image, use
single board import
If you’d like to import static images in bulk, make a feature suggestion via the
Atlassian Support
portal (if you are an app administrator).
📌 Are there any limits on how many boards I can import?
Import size is only limited by your Confluence plan's storage limit and Whiteboards limit, but we recommend batching imports (max 100 boards per import) to keep imports efficient. Here are the limits per plan:
Premium/Enterprise
:
Unlimited storage, Unlimited whiteboards
Standard:
250GB. If you exceed the storage limits of your Standard/Free plan, we’ll try to offer a free trial of Premium. If not, you’ll have 14 days to
reduce storage
or convert to a
paid plan
.
Free:
2GB. If you exceed the storage limits of your Standard/Free plan, we’ll try to offer a free trial of Premium. If not, you’ll have 14 days to
reduce storage
or convert to a
paid plan
.
📌 Are there limits on how many users I can transfer?
The importer allows you to add as many users as you like, but your Confluence plan’s user limits will still apply:
Standard/Premium/Enterprise:
Up to 150,000 users
Free:
10 users. If you exceed user limits of your Free plan, we’ll try to offer a free trial of Premium. If not, you’ll have 14 days to
remove users
or convert to a
paid plan
.
📌 How might importing boards impact my Confluence plan and billing?
Premium/Enterprise:
No impact
Standard:
If importing boards causes you to exceed your plan limits of 250GB storage, we will try to offer a free trial of a paid plan that fits your needs. If not, you’ll have 14 days to
reduce storage
or convert to a
paid plan
.
Free:
If importing boards causes you to exceed your plan limits of 10GB storage, we will try to offer a free trial of a paid plan that accommodates your new limits. If not, you’ll have 14 days to
remove users
or convert to a
paid plan
.
📌 How might adding Miro users impact my Confluence plan and billing?
Enterprise:
Input your expected, post-import new user count to our pricing calculator. Make sure to indicate if you are on the annual or monthly plan to get an accurate pricing estimate.
Premium/Standard:
Go to the
Premium user tiering guide
or
Standard user tiering guide
. If you are:
On the monthly plan: You pay a dynamic per-user price today. If the user transfer moves you up to a different user count tier, you will pay a new, lower per-user price.
On the annual plan: You pay a static annual price for your user tier today. If the user transfer moves you up to a different user count tier, your bill will increase to match that tier.
Free:
If adding Miro users causes your total user count to exceed the Free plan limit of 10 users, we willl try to offer a free trial of a paid plan that fits your user count. If not, you’ll have 14 days to
remove users
or convert to a
paid plan
.
📌 Can I import Miro guests?
No, guest accounts do not transfer. However, you can manually invite guests to a Confluence space from
admin.atlassian.com
.
