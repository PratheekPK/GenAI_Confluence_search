Differences using Confluence legacy editor and cloud editor
This page outlines the differences your team can expect
as a Confluence Data Center end-user
when moving to Confluence Cloud. Some of the capabilities listed below apply to more than one

Summary of differences
This table shows an overview of key differences between the cloud editor and the legacy editor. See below for more details. The

Differences administering Confluence Data Center and Cloud
1. Works differently in Cloud
Editor (cloud editor)
Works differently in Cloud.
What’s different
The editor in Confluence Cloud is significantly more modern and user-friendly than the editor in Confluence Data Center, known as the legacy editor. New pages are created using the cloud editor. Tables, images, macros, and page layouts all work a little differently, but are easier to use once you become familiar with the change. We’ve included more information about the most significant differences below.

Editor (legacy editor)
Works differently in Cloud.
What’s different
When you migrate, your existing pages will use the legacy editor, which is very similar to the editor in Confluence Server and Data Center. Users will have the option to convert existing pages to the new editor on a page-by-page basis, to avoid losing any formatting or macro data that isn't available in the new editor. Admins can also set up auto-conversion to streamline conversions on a space- or site-level.
When a page is converted, all compatible content is automatically converted to use the cloud editor elements. Incompatible content such as nested macros, will be added to the page inside the
legacy content macro
. This macro allows you to work with legacy content – with some limitations – on cloud editor pages.
By default, new pages are created in the cloud editor.

Macros
Works differently in the cloud editor.
What’s different
The way macros work in the cloud editor in Confluence Cloud is significantly more user-friendly than in Confluence Data Center. Many render visually in the editor, rather than as a placeholder. Some macros have been combined, while others are not available. Another significant difference is that macros can’t be nested (for example, you can’t put a code macro inside a panel macro).
Many of the Confluence Data Center macros are still available in the legacy editor template, and in migrated content that has not been converted to the new editor.

Nested macros
Works differently in the cloud editor.
What’s different
In Confluence Server there were not many restrictions on how macros could be used together. In the new editor, a macro with a body can’t be nested inside another macro. For example, you can’t put a code macro inside a panel macro. When an eligible page is converted to the cloud editor, your nested and incompatible macros will be inserted into the legacy content macro. Additionally, many third-party cloud apps have been updated to support nested body macros.

Tables
Works differently in the cloud editor.
What’s different
In Confluence Server, table options were provided in the editor toolbar. In Confluence Cloud, the way you interact with a table is a little different. The options are integrated into the table itself, which makes it more intuitive to add, remove, copy, and paste columns and rows, change the column width, cell color, and other characteristics of your table. The most significant changes your team might notice include that you can only choose from three preset table widths (no custom width), and you can’t nest one table inside another.

Templates
Works differently in the cloud editor.
What’s different
In Confluence Server, you select a template from the Create dialog when creating a page. In Confluence Cloud, you choose a template from within the page, and will get a preview of how it will look. There are over 100 templates to choose from, and you can download more from our website. Your existing templates will also be available.

Works differently in Cloud.
What’s different
In Confluence Server, unpublished pages (often known as drafts) were accessed from the Drafts list in your profile or Recently worked on in the dashboard. In Confluence Cloud, people can access pages they have contributed to from the page tree in the sidebar and the Recent drop-down menu in the header. Unpublished pages are much easier to access in Confluence Cloud.

Delete content and child items
Works differently in the cloud.
What’s different
In Confluence Server, users can delete the current page, or the current page and any child pages.
In Confluence Cloud:
For Standard plans, the users can delete the current content item (including pages, live docs, folders, whiteboards, and databases), or the current item and any child items.
For Enterprise and Premium plans, the users can delete pages in bulk by selecting the
Purge All
option under
Space settings > Manage content > Trash
.

2. Not available in Cloud

What’s different
In Confluence Data Center, users could edit an attached file in any compatible application using the Companion app. The Companion app was removed from Confluence Cloud in March 2022. To edit an attached file, you need to download the file, edit it in a compatible application, then manually re-upload it to the page.

3. Only available in cloud
We’ve included some significant features that are only available in cloud, as you may want to prepare your team for these as well.
Archive pages
Available in Cloud, on selected plans.
What’s different
In Confluence Server, you could archive a space to exclude pages in that space from search. In Confluence Cloud you can archive a space, or choose to archive individual pages. Archived pages don’t appear in the page tree, are still easy to access under Archived in the sidebar. You can bulk archive pages with a Premium or Enterprise plan.
