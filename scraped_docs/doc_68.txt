Create and edit content
In Confluence, you create content in a space as pages, live docs, blog posts, whiteboards, databases, or Smart Links in the content tree.
Templates
are pre-formatted and feature relevant macros and instructions to help you create retros, meeting minutes, how-to-articles, decisions, and more. You can edit any of these templates to suit your own needs, or you can create your own templates from scratch.
Just like other documents you've used, you can fill pages, live docs, and blog posts with text and tables, and format them to look pretty, funny, or professional. Confluence also lets you use
macros
and embed
files
so that you can have dynamic content in your documents, like videos, Jira issues, roadmaps, and automated reports.
The differences between pages and blogs include the following:
Published blogs are available in the Blog section of your space and are grouped chronologically. This means that they have a sense of timeliness and are more suited to announcements, news, and updates.
Published pages start as drafts and live in the content tree. They are highly versioned with a bifurcated view and edit mode, lending themselves well toward uses like documentation or policy creation. They can be nested and organized hierarchically, so you can have pages under pages (under pages). This lets you give your content structure and highlight relationships between pages, such as when you have a parent page about cats, and then child pages under that about different breeds of cats.
Live docs never have to be published and are best for fast, real-time, and collaborative work.  They’re perfect for capturing meeting notes, group reviews, or idea sessions. They’re also organized in the content tree and can nest, like pages. Pages and live docs can be converted into each other as needed anytime.
Every Confluence space, including your personal space, allows you to create pages and live docs in it, and has its own blog in which you can create posts.
