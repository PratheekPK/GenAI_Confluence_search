Integrate questions with your spaces
Confluence organizes its content in spaces. Questions recognizes that some content should be available anywhere—so questions can be created in the
global questions space
and organized just by topic, or asked
inside
a space, to inherit space permissions and keep things together.
If you have permissions to use Questions, you'll see
Questions
under the
Apps
menu in the Confluence
sidebar
, and questions will appear in your search results.
See questions asked in a space
When asking a question, people can choose to ask a question in a space. This might be for permissions reasons (to make the question private and only visible to people who can see that space) or to keep questions and content for a team or project together.
To view and search for questions in a space select
Questions
in the
Apps
menu of the
sidebar
.
The global questions space
When you install Questions for Confluence, a space for global questions is created. Global questions are questions that aren't asked in a specific Confluence space, but are instead posed to your whole site. You shouldn't delete this space, as deleting it will delete vital Questions info and Questions won't function as it should.
Questions macros
Add a list of questions to a page or live doc
One way to encourage users to use questions is to display them on pages and live docs using the Questions List macro. For example, if you use Confluence as your intranet, you might include the 5 most popular questions with the topic "human-resources" on pages for new starters in your team.
To add the macro to a page or live doc:
Begin typing /
Questions List
Select
Questions List
Enter the number of questions to display
Select a
filter
(you can choose to show recent, popular, or unanswered questions)
Enter
topics
(you can choose to match
all
or
any
of the topics you enter)
Choose a
Space
(leave this blank if you want to show all questions)
Hit
Insert
The macro will show all matching questions (including questions asked in any spaces you have permission to view).
Add an
Ask a question
link to a page or live doc
Encourage your users to ask their own questions by including a link to the
Create question
page or live doc.
To add an
Ask a question
link to a page or live doc:
Choose the link icon from the toolbar. This will open up the
Insert link
dialog.
Select
Web link
, then in the
Address
field, use the following URL, replacing <hostname> with your site URL (for example, on this site, we would use
confluence.atlassian.com
)
https://<hostname>/wiki/plugins/servlet/ac/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions/globalQuestionsViewer?ac.com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions.path=/questions/ask
This asks a question without limiting it by space. If you want the question to be asked in a specific space, use the following URL instead, replacing <hostname> with your site URL, and replacing <spaceKey> with that space's space key:
https://<hostname>/wiki/display/<spaceKey>/customcontent/list/ac:com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions:question?ac.com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions.path=/questions/ask
Add in the
Link text
(for example, you might choose
Ask a question
), then click
Save
.
Users who click on the text will then get taken to the following screen.
Clicking Ask a question will take users to this screen
Use Confluence macros with questions
The Filter by Label macro is great for displaying a list of questions, pages, live docs, and blogs that have a specific label (or topic) applied.
To add the macro to a page or live doc:
Begin typing
/Filter by label
Select
Filter by Label
Enter the topic or topics that you want displayed in the
Labels
field
Leave the
Include this Content Type Only field
blank
Hit
Insert
All content, including questions, pages, live docs, and blogs that contain the topics specified will appear in the list.
