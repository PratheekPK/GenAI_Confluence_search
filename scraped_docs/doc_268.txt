Confluence wiki markup syntax for the legacy editor
This page describes the wiki markup used on some administration screens in
Confluence Cloud
.
Wiki markup is useful when you want to do one of the following:
Create links using the
Advanced
tab of the Links Browser.
Add custom content to the
header
or
footer
of a space.
Insert a block of wiki markup (or markdown) into the Legacy editor. (Choose
Insert
>
Markup
.)
Note:
the new editor doesn’t support markup.
Can I insert markdown?
Confluence Cloud
supports inserting content in markdown. This is often used in ReadMe files. See
Keyboard shortcuts and autocomplete
for some examples.
To insert markdown in the
Legacy editor
:
Choose
Insert
>
Markup
.
Select
Markdown
.
Type or paste your text - the preview will show you how it will appear on your page.
Choose
Insert
.
As with wiki markup,
Confluence Cloud
will convert your markdown to the rich text editor format. You will not be able to edit your content using markdown.
Headings
There are six heading sizes,
h1
through
h6
. To format text as a heading, prefix the text with the name of the heading you want followed by a period:
Input
Output
h1. H1 heading
H1 heading
h2. H2 heading
H2 heading
h3. H3 heading
H3 heading
h4. H4 heading
H4 heading
h5. H5 heading
H5 heading
h6. H6 heading
H6 heading
Lists
Wiki markup allows you to create bulleted or numbered lists, and is flexible enough to allow a combination of the two list types.
To insert a line break in a list, type
//
. Empty lines may disrupt the list.
Bulleted lists
To create a bulleted list, type the asterisk followed by a space before each item on the list. Add more asterisks to create sub-items. Each additional asterisk adds another level.
Input
Output
* a bulleted item
* a bulleted item
** a bulleted sub-item
** a bulleted sub-item
* a bulleted item
a bulleted item
a bulleted item
a bulleted sub-item
a bulleted sub-item
a bulleted item
To get square bullets instead of round ones, use hyphens
-
instead of asterisks
*
.
Numbered lists
To create a numbered list, type the hash
#
followed by a space before each item on the list. As with bulleted lists, the number of hashes determines the level of the item.
Input
Output
# a numbered item
# a numbered item
#* a sub-item
#* a sub-item
# a numbered item
a numbered item
a numbered item
a sub-item
a sub-item
a numbered item
Sub-items in numbered lists may appear as capital letters (A, B, C), lowercase letters (a, b, c), Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3), or Roman numerals (i, ii, iii) depending on your browser and the style sheets installed on your
Confluence Cloud
site.
Mixed lists
You can combine these methods to create mixed numbered and bulleted lists as shown below.
Input
Output
# a numbered item
# a numbered item
#* a bulleted sub-item
#* a bulleted sub-item
# a numbered item
a numbered item
a numbered item
a bulleted sub-item
a bulleted sub-item
a numbered item
Tables
You can create simple tables using Confluence wiki markup, with columns separated by the pipe
|
and rows separated by line breaks. To give a cell a gray background, add a second pipe.
For example, the following input:
||heading 1||heading 2||heading 3||
|cell A1|cell A2|cell A3|
|cell B1|cell B2|cell B3|
Will produce this output:
heading 1
heading 2
heading 3
cell A1
cell A2
cell A3
cell B1
cell B2
cell B3
You can also create tables using the
column
and
section
macros. This method gives you more control over the size of table cells, but doesn’t produce highlighted cells. For more information, see
Table Type 2
in
this reference document
.
Embedded lists
You can use Confluence wiki markup to embed lists in tables, as in the following example:
||Heading 1||Heading 2||
|* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3|# Item 1
# Item 2
# Item 3|
The code above will produce the following table:
Heading 1
Heading 2
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Advanced table formatting
You can add color and other formatting options to your table using the
panel macro
and certain third-party
apps
(if your
Confluence Cloud
administrator has installed them on your site).

bq. blockquote
blockquote
You can also set the color of your text. For example, if you type
{color:red}your text{color}
, the phrase “your text” will appear in red.
Breaks
You can add paragraph breaks, line breaks, and horizontal rules in Confluence wiki markup.
Paragraph breaks
In Confluence wiki markup, paragraphs are created from any continuous line of text. To create paragraph break, insert two carriage returns after the paragraph text. This is the equivalent of wrapping text in a set of
<p></p>
tags in HTML.
Line breaks
There are two ways to create a line break within paragraph text:
Implicitly, by entering a single carriage return
Explicitly, by entering two consecutive backslashes
\\
These methods are equivalent to separating text with the
<br>
tag in HTML.
Most of the time, explicit line breaks aren’t required and a single carriage return is enough. However, they are necessary when you need to break up text in a single list item, as in the example below:
Input
Output
* Term 1
\\ definition
* Term 2
\\ definition
Term 1
definition
Term 2
definition
To use more than one explicit line break in a row, separate each one with a space, e.g.,
\\ \\
for two line breaks.
Horizontal rule
To create a horizontal line across the width of your page or content block, type four dashes in a row
----
at the beginning of a line, then press enter or space.
Make sure that the dashes are on a separate line from the rest of the text.
Input
Output
here is some text
----
divided by a horizontal rule
here is some text
divided by a horizontal rule
Links
Confluence wiki markup lets you add hyperlinks to text in certain administration screens. The table below illustrates the syntax for adding links.
Method
Result
[#anchor]
Link to an anchor link on the current page, where
anchor
is the name of the anchor.
[pagetitle^attached.ext]
Link to a file attached to the current page, where
pagetitle
is the name of the page and
attached.ext
is the name of the file.
[pagetitle]
Link to a specific page.
[pagetitle#anchor]
Link to an anchor on a specific page.
[pagetitle^attachment.ext]
Link to an attachment on a specific page.
[spacekey:pagetitle]
Link to a page in another space, where
spacekey
is the appropriate spacekey.
[spacekey:pagetitle#anchor]
Link to an anchor on a page in another space.
[spacekey:pagetitle^attachment.ext]
Link to a filed attached to a page in another space.
[/2004/01/12/blogposttitle]
Link to a blog post in the current space, where
blogposttitle
is the name of the blog as it appears on the page.
[spacekey:/2004/01/12/blogposttitle]
Link to a blog post in another space.
[spacekey:]
Link to the overview for another space.
[~username]
Link to the profile of a specific user.
[https://www.atlassian.com]
Link to an external website.
[mailto:service@atlassian.com]

service@atlassian.com
with the appropriate email address).
[file://z:/file/on/network/share.txt]
Link to a file on your computer or on a network share that you have mapped to a drive.
Only works with Internet Explorer.
[! https://external/image.png!|https://external/link.html ]
Displays an external image and links to an external website.
Confluence Cloud
treats headings as anchors, so you can link to headings with the following pattern:
[spacekey:pagename#headingname]
The
headingname
is case-sensitive and must be entered without spaces.
For each of the links in the table above:
You can prepend a link alias, so that alternate text is displayed on the page. For example:
[link alias|pagetitle#anchor]
You can append a link tip, which appears as a tooltip. For example:
[pagetitle#anchor|link tip]
Images
You can display images from attached files or remote sources.
Method
Result
!http://www.host.com/image.gif!
Displays an image from an external website on the page. Requires a fully qualified URL.
!attached-image.gif!
Displays an image file that is attached to the current page.
!pageTitle^image.gif!
Displays an image file that is attached to a different page in the same space.
!spaceKey:pageTitle^image.gif!
Displays an image file that is attached to a page in another space.
!/2010/05/23/My Blog Post^image.gif!
Displays an image file that’s attached to a blog post.
!image.jpg|thumbnail!
Displays an image attached to the current page as a thumbnail. Viewers can click on the thumbnail to see the full-sized image.
This feature only works with image files that are attached to the current page, and thumbnails must be enabled by the site administrator.
For any image, you can specify attributes of the HTML image tag in Confluence wiki markup in a comma-separated list appended to the URL. In the example below, the image will be aligned to the right of the page with 4 pixels of whitespace above and below:
!image.gif|align=right, vspace=4!
The following HTML image tag attributes are available:
Attribute
