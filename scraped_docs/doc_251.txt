Invite guests to Confluence
Not all teamwork happens inside the (sometimes virtual) walls of a single organization. Sometimes you need to partner with other companies to build integrations, work with agencies to bring marketing campaigns to life, bring in contractors and consultants to help get big projects over the line, and so on.
With single space guests, you can do all of that work without leaving Confluence.
Guests are free of charge (
up to 5 guests per paid user
). Total number of users (paid + guests) can't exceed the current Confluence site
user limit
.
Important policy information
You may not convert current or former paid users to guests. The purpose behind the guest feature is to invite users outside of your organization.
Atlassian reserves the right to restrict your access to the feature if you’re not using it in compliance with this purpose and the guidelines outlined in Atlassian documentation. Atlassian also reserves the right to change the ratio of guests to paid users.
To dive deeper into what to expect when collaborating with guests, see
What can guests see and do in Confluence?
Guests are not currently supported in Confluence mobile apps. For more information, see
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-76382
.
Give guests access to your Confluence site
To give guests access to your site, you need to:
Invite them to join your Atlassian organization.
Give them app access to Confluence as a guest.
Assign them the space they’ll be collaborating in.
Guests can’t use Confluence at all without space access
See
Assign space access to guests
for directions on how to get guests assigned the right space access.
Note:
Any guest that has app access to Confluence can access any spaces on that site that
allow anonymous users
.
Manage external users with added security
When bringing external people into your Confluence data, there’s always tension between the value of that collaboration and having clear and confident control over what areas of your data those external people should access.
With Atlassian’s external user security features, you can sleep well at night. These include:
Two-step verification
Periodic re-verification
Reviewing external users before changing security settings
API token access
Learn more about external user security
Invite guests and give them Confluence access
Only organization or site admins can invite guests to Confluence.
The first step in getting guests set up and collaborating on your Confluence site is to invite them to join your Atlassian organization. Next, those guests need to be given access to Confluence.
Give guests Confluence access individually
You can invite up to 10 guests at a time using this path.
Go to
admin.atlassian.com
. If you have more than one organization, select the one you want.
Select
Directory
>
Users
.
Select
Invite users
.
Add the email addresses of the guests you want to invite. (You can invite up to 10 guests at time.)
Open the app role dropdown for Confluence.
Unselect the
User
role.
If you don’t unselect this, the user will be considered a regular paid user.
Select the
Guest
role.
Make sure to select the correct role for all other apps. (Guests are only available in Confluence.)
If in doubt, skip the
Group membership
field. It’s not required.
(Optional) Personalize the email invite that the guests will receive.
Select
Invite users.
This is the 1st of a 2 step process.
Guests can’t access Confluence until you assign space access for them.
Give guests Confluence access via a guest group
Access management is often easier to manage (especially at scale) using groups.
To create a group
, see
Create groups
.
To change a group into a guest group:
Go to
admin.atlassian.com
and select the
Directory
tab.
Select
Groups
in the side navigation.
Search for the group you want to make a guest group.
Select the group name or
Show details
.
Go to the
Group app access
section at the bottom.
Find the right Confluence site and change the app role to
Guest
.
The group itself (as an object) won’t be added to Confluence. The system will read all members of the group and add them individually.
To invite new guests and give them Confluence access via a guest group:
Go to
admin.atlassian.com
.
Select
Directory
>
Users
.
Select
Invite users
.
Add the email addresses of the guests you want to invite. (You can invite up to 10 guests at time.)
Unselect all roles for all apps.
Search for and select the group or groups that you want to assign the guest to.
(Optional) Personalize the email invite that the guests will receive.
Select
Invite users.
As long as all groups you’ve selected have the guest role assigned to them, the users you’re adding to them will be granted the guest role automatically.
Make sure all groups are assigned the guest role
If any groups you add guests to have the “User” or “App admin” role, the guests will be given regular access to Confluence and considered paid users.
Give guests full access to Confluence
If working with your guest requires deeper collaboration, you can promote them into a licensed user with full access to Confluence.
To give a guest full access:
Go to
admin.atlassian.com
.
Select
Directory
>
Users
.
Search for the guest you want to promote.
Select the user’s name or ••• >
Show details
.
In
App access
, find the right Confluence site and open the app role dropdown.
Select
User.
Unselect
Guest
.
To give a guest group full access:
Go to
admin.atlassian.com
and select the
Directory
tab.
Select
Groups
in the side navigation.
Search for the group you want to make a guest group.
Select the group name or
Show details
.
Go to the
Group app access
section at the bottom.
Find the right Confluence site and change the app role to
User
.
Remove a guest’s access to Confluence
There are 2 ways to stop a guest from accessing Confluence:
unassign them from a space
remove their app access
To unassign a guest from a space,
see instructions in
Assign space access to guests
.
Without access to any space, a guest can’t access Confluence at all but will remain in the guest list. An app admin or space admin can reassign them to a space at any time.
To remove a guest from Confluence altogether:
Go to
admin.atlassian.com
.
Select
Directory
>
Users
.
Search for the guest you want to remove app access for.
Select the user’s name or ••• >
Show details
.
In
App access
, find the right Confluence site, open the app role dropdown, and unselect the check next to
Guest
.
This will remove the guest from the guest list in Confluence’s
Global permissions
.
