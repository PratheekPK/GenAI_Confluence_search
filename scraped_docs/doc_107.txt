Coming soon: Deprecation of the legacy editor
In June 2025, Atlassian
announced the deprecation
of the legacy editor. This will be a phased process beginning in January 2026. Find out more in the
FAQ article
.
When the process is complete in April 2026, all editing will take place in the cloud editor. Until then, you will continue to have the option to update pages in the legacy editor. However, there are some downsides to continuing to use the legacy editor:
No bugs fixed unless it's a major incident.
No enhancements.
In the history of Confluence, we've occasionally made it far easier to do something without removing the more complex way of doing that thing. There was a time when you had to open the macro browser and find the
strikethrough macro
just to add a line through your text. We later added a strikethrough button to the toolbar (much faster!) but still kept that strikethrough macro around.
Below you'll find a list of the no-longer-needed macros that are being removed from the cloud editor along with alternative methods you can use to get the same results. For macros that are slated for removal, you can use the
Macro Usage
feature in Confluence Administration to better understand how they are used in your site.
