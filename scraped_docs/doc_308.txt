Simplify data with tables
By using tables appropriately, you can ensure that your data is easy to read and understand while maintaining a clean and organized layout. In this guide, we will cover how to create, edit, format, and manage tables, ensuring that you get the most out of this versatile feature.
Creating a table
Creating a table in Confluence is straightforward and allows you to quickly organize and present your data. Follow these steps to add a table to your page or live doc:
From the toolbar or / command:
Select
Table
in the toolbar or type
/table
.
You can also insert a table with keyboard shortcuts:
shift
+
option
+
T
for Mac or
shift
+
alt
+
T
for Windows.
A three-column, three-row table (including a header row) will appear.
Customizing table size:
You can also select the
Table size
menu in the toolbar to set the number of columns and rows according to your needs.
When you have large tables with many rows, the header row becomes “sticky” and doesn't scroll out of view when editing or viewing content. This helps maintain context while working with extensive data sets. Note that this doesn't work if you've merged several rows to create a bigger header row.
Remember, while tables are excellent for presenting data. For more complex formatting, consider using macros or other layout options available in Confluence Cloud.
Editing a table's rows and columns
Editing the structure of a table is essential for organizing your data effectively. You can easily add, remove, merge, and split rows and columns to fit your needs. Here’s how:
Adding and removing rows and columns
Using the drag handle menu
To add a column, select the column drag handle and select
Add column left
or
Add column right
from the menu.
To add a row, select the row drag handle and select
Add row above
or
Add row below
from the menu.
To remove a column, select the column drag handle and select
Delete column
from the menu.
To remove a row, select the row drag handle and select
Delete row
from the menu.
Using the insert options
To add a new column, hover over the column line at the top of the table until the insert column option appears, then select it to add.
To add a new row, hover over the row line to the left of the table until the insert row option appears, then select it to add.
Using
Tab
from the final cell in a table will add a new row to the bottom of the table.
Merging and splitting cells
Merge cells:
Select the cells you want to combine, then select the
Merge cells
option from the cell menu.
Split cells:
Select the merged cell you want to split, then select the
Split cells
option from the cell menu.
Reordering columns and rows
Drag and drop:
You can reorder columns and rows by selecting, dragging, and dropping them into the desired position using the drag handles. This allows you to organize your table dynamically.
Hold the
Shift
key to select multiple rows or columns before dragging and dropping them together.
Table options for rows and columns
Fixed column widths:
Determine if your table behaves as a fixed-width or variable-width table on different screen sizes.
Row and column header styles:
For better readability and organization, make a row a header row or a column a header column with a grey-shaded background and bold text from
Table options
from the table toolbar.
Numbered column:
Insert a numbered column from
Table options
from the table toolbar to automatically number each row, useful for data that requires indexing.
By editing your table’s rows and columns, you can ensure that your data is presented in a clear and structured manner, making it easier for users to read and understand.
Sorting table data
Sorting data within a table helps you organize information and make it easier to read. Here’s how you can sort your table data:
Sort columns
Select the column handle you want to sort.
Select the option to sort the data in ascending or descending order from the menu that appears.
Sorting your table data allows you to present information in a logical sequence, making it easier for users to understand and analyze the content.
Changing table layout and style
Changing the layout and style of your table helps enhance its readability and visual appeal. Here’s how you can customize your table:
Changing cell background color
Select the cells you want to format.
Select the background color option from the cell menu to apply the desired color.
Aligning tables
Use the alignment button in the table toolbar to align tables to the left or center of the page or live doc.
Note that tables inserted in full-width pages are left-aligned by default.
Using guides for alignment
Guides appear to help align your table width with other content on the page or live doc.
Set your table width to one of the following three default widths: centered, wide, or full-width.
By changing the layout and style of your table, you can ensure that your data is presented in an organized and visually appealing manner, making it easier for users to read and understand.
Resizing tables and columns
Customizing the size of tables and columns allows your data to fit well within your content layout. Here’s how to resize tables and columns:
Resizing the whole table
Locate the resize handle on the right side of the table.
Drag the resize handle to adjust the table to the desired width.
Resizing individual columns
Drag the column borders to adjust the width of individual columns.
Use the
Distribute columns
button to make selected columns the same width.
Setting column widths to fixed
Open the
Table options
in the table toolbar.
Select the option to set column widths to fixed. This option is unchecked by default, allowing tables to scale dynamically.
Fixed column widths ensure your table layout remains consistent even on narrow screens. For those who prefer dynamic responsiveness, we’ve increased the maximum scaling flexibility.
By resizing your tables and columns, you can ensure your data presentation fits your content layout and enhances readability.
Deleting a table
Deleting a table is straightforward and helps you keep your content organized. Here’s how you can remove a table from your page or live doc:
Select the table you want to delete.
Select
Remove
in the floating toolbar that appears below the table.
If you have any charts linked to your table, you will be given the option of deleting them.
By deleting unnecessary tables, you can maintain a clean and well-organized page or live doc, making it easier for users to find and focus on relevant information.
Visualizing table data
Transform your table data into dynamic charts to make it easier to review, monitor, and present. Visit Charts and connected data to learn how to create and customize charts from your table data.
