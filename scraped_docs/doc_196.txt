Learn about the features of Confluence Cloud plans
Plans in Confluence Cloud let you choose the right features and functionality for your stage of business. From teams of three where you share everything, up to enterprises with thousands of staff where visibility and control are paramount, there's a plan to suit your needs.
This page outlines which Confluence features come with different cloud plans and provides information about changing your existing plan by starting a trial.
If you’re looking for plan pricing:
The
Confluence Cloud pricing page
lets you estimate what each Confluence Cloud plan would cost depending on the number of users you have and whether you choose a monthly or annual billing cycle.
To see pricing tables, find the cloud plan you’re interested in under
Cloud Pricing & Licensing
, open the “What is monthly (or annual) pricing” question in the plan’s FAQs, and select Confluence.
What do I get with each plan?
Free
The Free plan is for small teams of up to 10 people who are just getting started with Confluence.
On the Free plan you get:
Seats for up to 10 users
2 GB of file storage
Unlimited spaces and pages
Support from the
Atlassian Community
(a public forum of community experts where you can ask questions)
Permissions
aren't customizable and anonymous access isn't available. Everyone who can log in to your Confluence Free instance can view, add, and edit spaces and content.
If you migrate from Confluence Data Center to a free Confluence Cloud plan — or if you move from a paid Confluence Cloud plan to Confluence Free — your existing global, space, and content permissions will be retained, but anonymous access will be disabled. You won’t be able to change permissions or enable anonymous access unless you upgrade to a paid plan. Read more about
permissions and restrictions in the Free plan
.
Confluence instances on the Free plan will be
deactivated after 120 days of inactivity
.
To avoid deactivation, just log in and view any Confluence content — that’ll count as activity and reset the 120-day clock.
If your instance is at risk of being deactivated due to inactivity, we’ll email the Confluence admin so they can log in and prevent deactivation.
Standard
As your team grows and you need tighter access control, file storage, and better support, you can move to a paid plan.
On the Standard plan you get:
Seats for up to 150,000 users
(but you only pay for users or user tier that you have)
250 GB of file storage
Control of global, space, and content
permissions
Audit logs
for keeping track of important changes
Archive content items
to help keep information current
Public links
Data residency
to control where your in-scope product data is hosted
Standard customer support
(available 9am–5pm Monday to Friday for your time zone)
If you expect to have more than 5,000 users with more than 50% of them actively using Confluence at the same time (concurrently), the Premium plan — which has optimized cloud infrastructure — might be a better option for you.
Most enterprise organizations that use our apps regularly tend to have heavier concurrent usage.
Premium
When you choose the Premium plan, you’ll get everything from the Standard plan, plus:
Advanced app features
Atlassian Intelligence
includes
AI writing assistance
AI-powered summaries
Natural language automation
AI definitions (beta)
Q&A search in Confluence (beta)
Automation
to organize spaces and send reminders that keep work on track

99.9% uptime service level agreement (SLA)
You can also add enterprise-grade identity access management (IAM) features like SSO and SCIM to any Premium or Standard plan by subscribing to
Atlassian Guard Standard
(formerly known as Atlassian Access)
.
Enterprise
The Enterprise plan gets you everything from the Premium plan, plus:
Multiple app instances, up to 150, in the same plan
Centralized per-user pricing
(Give users access to multiple Confluence Enterprise apps but only pay for each user once)
99.95% uptime service level agreement (SLA)
Atlassian Guard Standard
is included, enabling authentication controls (like SSO and SCIM) and centralized oversight
To learn more about the Enterprise plan, fill out our
contact form
and someone from our team will reach out.
Changing your plan
Changing your plan starts with a trial, and plan trials are available to all Confluence Cloud customers at no extra cost.
If you're on a monthly paid subscription, the trial will last for the remainder of your current and next full billing cycle. Cancel any time during the trial period if you decide you don't want to change plans.
If you’re on an annual paid subscription, you can try another plan for 30 days from the day you start the trial.
If you’re on the Free plan, you can try the Standard plan for 14 days and the Premium plan for 30 days.
Contact us
if you’re interested in trying the Enterprise plan.
During a trial you can use all the features available on the new plan, but the SLA compensation available on the Premium and Enterprise plans won’t commence until your trial has ended.
Once the trial finishes, you'll be placed onto the new plan and charged the new amount at the end of your billing cycle.
If you move to a lower plan level, you can keep using the features available in your current plan until the end of your billing period.
Not sure which plan you're on?
Site admins (and Org admins with Confluence admin provisioning) can access
Billing
in
admin.atlassian.com
. The Billing preview table has a Plan column that shows the current plan name beside the app name.
To trial a different plan
You need to be an Atlassian Cloud site admin (or org admin with Confluence admin provisioning) to complete these steps.
Select the wheel icon (
) in the top-right corner to open Confluence administration.
Select
Billing
under
Atlassian Administration
Find Confluence in the Billing preview table and select
Manage
Select
Change
next to your plan name
Select the plan you’re considering switching to
You’ll be prompted to review information and confirm the start of your trial
To change from a paid plan to the Free plan, you’ll first need to remove users until you have 10 or fewer.
If you're over the 10-user limit when you try to change your plan to Confluence Free, the change will fail and you'll remain on your current plan.
Free cloud migration trials for Confluence Data Center customers
If you're using Confluence Data Center and trialing Confluence Cloud, your cloud migration trial period lasts for the remainder of your existing license period, up to 12 months.
We don't recommend changing to the Confluence Free plan during your cloud migration trial.
If you change to the Free plan during your migration trial period, the cloud migration trial will end immediately. You'll need to upgrade to a Standard or Premium Confluence Cloud plan to keep using their additional features.
