Confluence automation
Confluence automation is a  feature that can help teams manage their content at scale. When space or app admins create and enable automation rules, Confluence automation works behind the scenes to complete routine functions that would otherwise have to be done manually. For example, rules can automatically:
Create new content in the correct format.
Send team updates on work progress.
Remind people about incomplete tasks.
Learn how to
manage automation
in Confluence Cloud.
To learn about automation in other Atlassian apps, explore our
Cloud automation
documentation.
What can Confluence automation do?
Automation, generally speaking, does what it sounds like: It automates routine functions that would otherwise wait for a person to do them.
In Confluence, this might mean automating workflows like:
“When new pages or live docs are created in this space, message this Slack channel.”
“When a person from this group creates new pages or live docs, add this label.”
Depending on how your team uses Confluence (for collaborative work or as a knowledge base), automating certain functions may be more useful than others. Here are four key areas we expect automation to be especially helpful:
Integrating tools
Send automated work updates to team
Slack
and
MS Teams
channels
Connect third-party apps and services using the webhook trigger
Tracking the content lifecycle
Enforce publishing processes and keep content up to date
Make related content more discoverable by managing and auto-adding page or doc labels
Keeping spaces organized
Set up new spaces with a consistent page tree structure
Auto-create team documents, like meeting notes, in a standard location in the page tree
Staying informed
Meet deadlines and keep teams connected with automated reminders and notifications to
Complete assigned tasks
See when work progresses without having to manually check or ask for updates
Rules
Rules
are automated workflows constructed in an “If This, Then That” format.
Confluence
admins can create and enable rules that function at the global level.
Space
admins can create and enable rules for individual spaces. (And while you may not think of yourself as an admin, if you have a
personal space
you’re an administrator of your space!)
If you don’t see Automation
in Confluence administration or Space settings, this might be why:
You’re not an admin of the space you’re in (for Space automation)
You’re not a Confluence app admin (for Global automation)
Learn how to
create rules
in Confluence automation.
Rule components
Each rule is made by combining different types of
components
: triggers, conditions, branches, and actions. Think of components as the building blocks of a rule. (If you’ve used automation in other non-Atlassian apps, you may have also seen this described as the ingredients that make a recipe.)
Triggers
(WHEN this happens…)
Rules always begin with a trigger component. The trigger is the catalyst that sets the execution of your rule in motion.
See a list of available triggers in Confluence
.
Conditions
(IF certain conditions are met…)
Condition components are optional. They limit the scope of your rule. For example, you could add a
User
condition so that “when new pages or live docs are published”, the rule only runs if the pages or live docs were published by a specific user.
See a list of available conditions in Confluence
.
Branches
(FOR EACH [object]…)
Branch components are also optional. They expand the execution of your rule by adding a secondary path (a branch). The branch is a sequence of conditions and/or actions that run in isolation from the rest of the rule — but are applied to every instance of an object. For example, you could branch the rule
for each task
(task being the object) so that “when new pages or live docs are published”, you receive a Slack message (an action) for every task on pages or live docs that’s assigned to you (the task criteria). This would happen in addition to actions added to the primary path of the rule chain.
See a list of available branches in Confluence
.
Actions
(THEN do this thing…)
Rules always end with an action component. Actions are what you want the rule to do, that is, what you want to happen after it executes successfully.
See a list of available actions in Confluence
.
Rule builder
When you select the
Create rule
button, a rule builder opens where you can build a new rule from scratch (instead of starting with a rule template). It guides you to add and configure components, starting with a triggering event. Each component you save will appear in a rule chain on the left.
Rule template
Templates can be found in the
Templates
tab within automation. A rule template functions similarly to a page or doc template: It provides a starting point with appropriate components pre-selected and arranged in a rule chain. Select each component in the rule chain to configure and save it.
Rule chain
When you view a rule or rule template, the rule chain is an ordered list of components on the left. These are the instructions (the chain of events) for your rule. Once the rule is enabled, components will run in the order they appear from top to bottom. Drag and drop to reorder them. Hover and select the X to remove them.
Rule summary
There’s a link above the rule chain to edit
Rule details
like the name, description, and rule actor. You can also troubleshoot an existing rule by viewing execution data in its
audit log
. Together the rule details, rule actor, audit log, and rule chain summarize all the information about a particular rule.
Rule actor
When your rule performs an action, it’s performed on behalf of the individual (or group) listed as the
rule actor
. For example, if your rule ultimately sends an email – the name of the rule actor appears in the “From” line. In Confluence, the rule actor defaults to the person who created the rule. If you’re creating rules for another team, this can be changed (in
Rule details
) so that actions appear to originate from the appropriate team member or group. (In Jira, the rule actor can also be set generically as “Jira automation”, but this isn’t currently an option in Confluence.)
Smart values
When you configure components to add to your rule, you may be prompted with an option to use
smart values
. They can look a little intimidating, but using them is easier than you might think.
Smart values are dynamic variables that make your rule more flexible. They serve as placeholders where information gets plugged in, depending on context.
For example if you build a rule that notifies people when their pages or live docs are edited, you might include smart values to dynamically plug in:
the name of the contributing editor(s)
the date
the title of the edited page(s) or live docs
See a list of available smart values in Confluence
.
