Add elements to a page or live doc
Along with the text you add to a page or live doc, elements are the building blocks that help you organize and present information in the way you want.
All the items that can be inserted onto a page are
elements.
Elements include dates, status lozenges, panels, Confluence macros, and Marketplace macros.
What are macros?
Confluence macros are a sub-set of elements that help you extend functionality. Macros usually have a more complex setup than basic elements like a date or a status.

Does your toolbar look different?
Your toolbar or editing controls may appear differently from usual, or from how they appear in this documentation. We’re rolling out features that are subject to change.
How to pin your toolbar and navigate editing updates
Basic elements
These elements can be inserted from the
menu, from the toolbar, or from the slash command menu.
Action items
Add a checklist item and assign the task to another person using an @ mention. Items assigned to others show up in their tasks list under their profile. They can tick them off as the task is completed. If a date is added, the task turns red if it becomes past due.
Type
/action
to quickly add this element from the slash command.
Code snippet
Code snippets let you format source code with numbered rows and syntax highlighting based on the language you choose.
They can be added in a few different ways:
Select
Code
from the
More formatting
menu in the main toolbar.
Type
/code
to quickly add this element from the slash command, or select it manually from the
Insert/
menu in the main toolbar.
Type three back ticks, i.e ``` with the keyboard to create a code block. You can also type ``` before a line of text to add this to the code block.
Type text between two back ticks, i.e `some text` to create inline code.
Date
Make a date stand out with grey background; the default date format is
Mon DD, YYYY
.
Type
//
to bring up a date picker.
Decision
Emphasize a distinct decision made for a project or by a team by adding a grey background panel and a green icon.
Type
/decision
to quickly add this element from the slash command.
Divider
Separate sections of text using a horizontal line.
Type
/divider
to quickly add this element from the slash command.
Emoji
Express a feeling, emotion, or info type with an image. The library of emojis available are a combination of standard Confluence emojis and those added by users of your site.
Learn more about emojis
Type
/emoji
to quickly add this element from the slash command.
Expand
Create a collapsed section that reveals more information for the people who seek it. This is a useful formatting element when the amount of info on a page or doc is overwhelming at first glance.
Type
/expand
to quickly add this element from the slash command.
Heading
Format text to represent the hierarchy of information on a page or live doc. Once headings are created, use the
Table of Contents Macro
to generate a list of links pointing to the headings on your content. The list of links appears wherever you add the macro, and it automatically updates each time someone changes the wording of a heading or the heading level.
Type
/heading
to quickly see the options and add this element from the slash command.
Mention
Reference a person and let them know about it. The user mentioned receives a notification.
Type
@
and enter part of a name to narrow the list of matches.
Panel
Emphasize information by choosing a preset panel type to consistently communicate ideas like info, note, error, success, and warning. The preset types include an emoji and a background color.
In addition to the five preset panel options, you can customize panels by choosing one of the 20 background colors available. Panels can have emojis, or you can remove the emoji to meet the needs of your content. The emojis available to you are the same set that you already use in Confluence; this includes custom emojis you and your teammates have added.
Type
/panel
to quickly see the options and add this element from the slash command.
Quote
Emphasize a quote by adding a vertical line on its left margin and adjusting the font color.
Type
/quote
to quickly add this element from the slash command.
Status
Highlight text to stand out and choose the background color that fits its meaning.
Type
/status
to quickly add this element from the slash command.
